The quizzes and assignments have a question paper which lays out all details. Hence, documentation is not necessary.
Regarding the sudoku assignment, You will have doubts, please reach out to me. I will explain everything.

Also, my code is not that good. Its because I was a beginner when I did this course.

It was good in a way that it enabled me to self-learn. I believe I have written too many comments in the code. 

My thinking was that even a layman should be able to understand what happens. Also, if at any point in my life, I go back and look at the code, I myself must be able to understand it quickly.

Because of all the comments I have written in the code, I believe I don't need to give any detailed explanation in this readme. 

if you have doubts, reach out to me.

I have very less time at present so as to update this documentation. Maybe in future, I will update this whole readme.

Thank you! and hope my submission is useful to you.
