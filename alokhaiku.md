Nightmare Daddy's going to take you around <br>
To where the hunger turns to hatred <br>
You feel the pain, you hear the sound <br>
Of the crying at the gate <br>
Now you ring for the conductor <br>
But you find that he is gone <br>
The smell of blood is in the air <br>
The curtains have been drawn <br>
